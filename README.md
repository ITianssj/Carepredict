This is a Flask-based web application for predicting seven different diseases using machine learning and deep learning models. The models have been trained to predict the following diseases:

1. Alzheimer's Disease
2. Brain Tumor
3. Breast Cancer
4. COVID-19 Detection
5. Diabetes
6. Heart Disease
7. Pneumonia

Models
- Alzheimer's Disease: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Brain Tumor: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Breast Cancer: Random Forest
- COVID-19 Detection: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Diabetes: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Heart Disease: XGBoost
- Pneumonia: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The accuracy of each model on its respective dataset is as follows:

- Alzheimer's: 83%
- Brain Tumor: 86%
- Breast Cancer: 94%
- COVID-19 Detection: 95%
- Diabetes: 77%
- Heart Disease: 86%
- Pneumonia: 89%

## Usage
- Select a disease from the list.
- Upload a relevant medical image for prediction.

## Run the Flask application:
go to Carepredict/app.py 
python app.py
